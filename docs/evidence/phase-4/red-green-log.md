# Phase 4 RED–GREEN–REFACTOR log

## Task 1 — Authority and graybox evidence boundary

Date: 2026-08-13

- Approval: owner authorized deterministic Phase 4 Tasks 1–15. Tasks 16–17, live kickoff, executable role promotion, high-fidelity art, Phase 5, deployment, and external effects remain unauthorized.
- Documentation: governing boundary and planning statuses were updated; D-27 reconciles Phase 4 as graybox office and collaborative kickoff, with art direction retained in later phases.
- RED: `node --test scripts/graybox-evidence.test.mjs` failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` because the graybox evidence validator did not exist.
- GREEN: 3 tests passed. Candidate Phase 4 graybox evidence is accepted; Active, high-fidelity, golden-state, art-direction-approved, malformed, wrong-phase, extra-field, and secret-bearing claims are rejected.
- REFACTOR: formatting applied; the focused test remained green.
- Verification: focused Node test, ESLint, TypeScript, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Invariant: graybox rendered evidence can prove composition and interaction only. It cannot promote an asset, token, baseline, golden state, or art direction.
